          Hi! I am a PhD student at Duke studying cognitive neuroscience.
          My main research interests are learning, memory, and cognitive control.
          <br><br>
          Outside of lab, I am also a free-lance translator (see translated
          books <a href = "https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9331">here</a>
           and <a href = "https://www.routledge.com/The-Beauty-of-Mathematics-in-Computer-Science-1st-Edition/Wu/p/book/9781138049604">here</a>)
           and a volunteer board member of an educational non-profit called
           <a href = "https://www.tellurideassociation.org/">Telluride Association</a>.

        <h2> Research</h2>
        <p>
          At Duke, I work with <a href = "https://www.adcocklab.org/">Alison Adcock</a>
          and <a href = "https://www.egnerlab.org/">Tobias Egner</a>.
          My main research questions are: <br><br>
          - How do motivational factors influence episodic memory and learning?
          <br><br>- How does control context shape event perception?<br><br>
          - What are the biological and cultural underpinnings of emotion perception?
          <br><br>See more details below:
        </p>

          <div>
          <h2> Motivation and Memory</h2>
          <p>
            Memory is not a veridical record of experience, but rather influenced by
            both external and internal factors such as contexts and motivational states.
            I am interested how reward motivation modulates various aspects of episodic
            memory, such as temporal perception and hierarchical representations on
            multiple scales. Specifically, I hope to investigate interactions between
            the midbrain dopaminergic system and hippocampal dynamics using neuroimaging
            and computational modeling approaches.
          </p>

          <h2> Control Demand and Event Cognition</h2>
          <p>
            Although our daily experiences are continuous, they are segmented into
            discrete episodes in long-term memory. Both internal and external factors,
            such as changes in goals or shifts in environmental contexts, can influence
            the online segmentation of a continuous stream of experience. In context
            control learning, temporal episodes of varying task difficulty are thought
            to serve as a cue for adjusting the exertion of cognitive control. My work
            current work explores how changes in cognitive demand impact encoding of
            task episodes and the memory consequences.

          <h2> Emotion Perception</h2>
          <p>
            Prior to starting graduate school at Duke, I studied affective
            neuroscience at Pomona College with Richard Lewis and <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/affectiveandbrainscienceslab/">Ajay Satpute</a>. In
            one <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40167-018-0067-1">study</a>,
            we examined emotion perception from eye gaze in Asian American bi-cultural
            individuals using EEG. My <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57653-z">thesis</a>
            research focused on affect processing in the human superior colliculus
            (a midbrain structure in the oculomotor system) using ultra high field 7-Tesla fMRI.
